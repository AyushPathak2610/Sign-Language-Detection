# Sign Language Detection 
This repository contains an implementation of a sign detection model using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model leverages the MediaPipe library for extracting keypoint information from video frames.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to detect and recognize signs or gestures made by a person in front of a camera. The model combines the power of CNNs for spatial feature extraction with LSTMs for temporal modeling. Key point information is extracted using the MediaPipe library, providing a rich representation of hand movements.

# Dependencies
1. Python 3.x
2. TensorFlow
3. MediaPipe
4. NumPy
